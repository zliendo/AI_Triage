# Interpretable Deep Attention Neural Networks for assisting Triage

**May 2018**

This repository contains the code I implemented for [IDANN Triage](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2018/idann-triage), which was the capstone project for my Masters on Data Science 
at UC Berkeley. This project was implemented on May 2018.

IDANN Triage helps emergency departments to identify and prioritize patients significantly ill by predicting critical outcomes; it utilizes deep neural networks with an attention layer for model interpretability. IDANN captured 37.4% more critical outcomes.

[Code after refactorization](https://github.com/idanntriage/idann_triage)

I implemented code for data pre-preprocessing, deep learning models with an interpretation layer, visualizations and javascript API.
