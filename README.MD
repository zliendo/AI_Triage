# Interpretable Deep Attention Neural Networks for assisting Triage

**May 2018**

This repository contains the code I implemented for [IDANN Triage](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2018/idann-triage), which was the capstone project for my Masters on Data Science 
from UC Berkeley. This project was implemented on May 2018.
